        All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line
        Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the
        stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the
        Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team
        because he hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if
        Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys
        were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their
        veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family
        was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s
        owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to
        anyone in the wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the
        family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black
        mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink,
        and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with
        brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore
        round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. It
        was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a
        wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of
        the reason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years
        before. At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse
        from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name
        most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died
        in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar,
        and somehow — nobody understood why —Voldemort’s powers had been
        destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. So Harry had been
        brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her husban
