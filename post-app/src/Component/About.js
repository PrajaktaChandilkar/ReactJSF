        “Pass the frying pan.” “You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry
        irritably. The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family
        was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that
        shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped
        her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing
        in his temples. “I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean
        —” “WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the
        table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” “But I —” “HOW DARE YOU
        THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.
        “I just —” “I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR
        ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle
        to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. “All
        right,” said Harry, “all right…” Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing
        like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners
        of his small, sharp eyes. Ever since Harry had come home for the summer
        holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go
        off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter
        of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be. Harry Potter was
        a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of
        Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him
        back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt. He missed
        Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed
        the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though
        perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating
        banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower
        dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the
        Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most
        popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying
        balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).
